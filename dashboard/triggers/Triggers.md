# < [Dashboard](../README.md) - Triggers

A Trigger is an event that occurs in an app that can be used to start an Automation. In a todo app, for example, a trigger might be the creation or completion of a task; in an event booking event app, a trigger might be a new event being booked.

This view allows you to create new or update existing Triggers for your app.
